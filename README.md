# Game-of-Life
In this Project I will be rebuilding John Conway's "Game of Life" in Java.

## Rules
The game of life takes place in a 2D boolean grid. There are 3 rules:
  - is the Value of the cell in the grid true, it will stay true if it has 2 or 3 true  neighbour cells
  - a false cell turns true, if it has 3 true neighbour cells
  - if there are less than 2 or more than 3 neighbour cells, the cell turns false

## Basic coding concepts
  - Loops, if-else condition, Arrays
  - Methods
  - Rekursion
  - Objects and OOP
